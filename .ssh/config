#  Summary: Default User ssh client configuration settings
#
# - Host Settings used by ssh client for all connections.
#
# - For additional details on the purpose of each directive below in configuring the ssh
#   client behavior visit https://www.openssh.com/manual.html or run the following command:
#
#   $ man ssh
#
# - The defaults can be overridden in specific host directives further down to accomodate for
#   sshd daemon conifgurations and defaults used by less common host operating systems.  Normally,
#   this is not often needed, but for an example see the ControlPath directive defaults and the
#   override needed to enable ssh client access without generating weird errors in OpenShift v1.

# TODO: Test all hosts below as I seem to recall there might have been a specific reason I moved the 
# default directive the bottom of the file when I originally wrote it, though I can't remember exactly
# what that was at the moment...though I seem to recall it may have had something to do with the wildcard
# that I had to use to handle key-based logins for the range of RedHat FQDNs we might need to login to
# when using OpenShift....haven't used it in a while so may need to validate if this is even necessary....
